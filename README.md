Welcome to patternfly-design!
=============================

The "patternfly-design" repo is a place for tracking design work for the PatternFly project. You can see our issues backlog and work in progress in the [PF4 Design Workspace](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/pf4-design-workspace-5b2142ff9499cb7cdaf1e632/board?repos=39903854,61041252&showPRs=false&showClosed=false&showLabels=false&showEpics=false)

Request a new feature or feature enhancement by opening a new issue in this repo. Issues will be reviewed monthly and, if accepted, placed on the [PatternFly Feature Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/patternfly/projects/4). Visit our [contribution page](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/contribute/design) to learn more about contributing to patternfly-design.

Note: this repo also holds content exposed on the PatternFly 3 website in the `pattern-library` and `styles` folders. This content is maintained for anyone still using PatternFly 3. The most recent PatternFly 4 icon SVG's and associated files can be found in the `resources` folder.
