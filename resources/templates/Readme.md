## PatternFly Template for Balsamiq Wireframes
This template allows Balsamiq Wireframes users to create wireframes that are consistent with a PatternFly look and feel.  You can use this to create wireframes that will be closer to actual PatternFly screens than you would get by using Balsamiq out of the box.  It uses the Balsamiq wireframe skin and Open Sans as the default font face. **For best results, use Balsamiq Wireframes 4.0 or higher.**

To use the template, simply download the `Template-PatternFly-v4.bmpr` file to your hard drive and open in Balsamiq Wireframes.  Do a **Save Project As…** to copy the content to a new file that you will edit.  That way you will keep the original template unchanged for future use.  When you open this up, you will see some sample views and patterns that can be reused to save you from needing to draw these from scratch.  There are a few things you should know when using this template:

1. You need to be comfortable working with Symbols.  PatternFly components are implemented as symbols which you can open, modify, and reuse.  If you are unfamiliar with working with symbols in Balsamiq, you can find more information here: [https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/docs/symbols/](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/docs/symbols/)

2. Balsamiq Wireframes ships with FontAwesome icons, so many of the icons you are looking for are already included.  Bitmaps for PatternFly unique icons have been added to the template and will show up whenever you do an icon search.  PatternFly icons are prefaced with “pf_” in the icon name.

That’s all you should need to know, so happy wireframing!   If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute to this template, please feel free to contact Matt Carrano <mcarrano@redhat.com> on the Red Hat UXD team or post a question to the `patternfly-design` channel on Slack.
